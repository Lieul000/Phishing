# PHISHING CAMPAIGN

First, I recommend to create a brand new email address related to nothing (do not link it with your phone number or gmail anything).

### creating a password app with outlook

I tried with proton but since I get a free account, I was not able to get one.
Finally I went with outlook through the security config in my profil.

### installing gophish
Gophish is pretty easy to use and the interface is pretty intuitive.
If sormething went wrong you will see an error message pop up and will be able to know what went wrong and find some ressources online to fix it (so do not forget to check the message error and his meaning)

1- create a sending profile (do not forget to send a test email)
Regarding SMTP port you can choose between 465  (Secure Transport â€” SSL function enabled)or 587 (Insecure Transport, but can be upgraded to a secure connection using STARTTLS).
It should look something like this : smtp-mail.outlook.com:587

2-  create a landing page
here a some example :

3- create a mail template
here are some example in hmtl format :

Depending on the interest of the targeted people, you can customise the mail's content. 
Try to be appealing and to put a sense of emergency to get the target to click. Work on your story telling.

4- create a user group

5- create a campaign and check if it is successfull.
